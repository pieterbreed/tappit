# tappit

A Clojure library for producing [TAP](http://testanything.org/) output.

This work is inspired by [this python TAP library](https://github.com/rjbs/tapsimple).

## Usage

### Example1

Based on [this Python `tapsimple` module example (https://github.com/rjbs/tapsimple/blob/master/examples/ok.t).]

```
(with-tap!

  ;; plan 15 tests, only make 13
  (plan-for! 15)

  (ok! 1)
  (ok! 1 "everything is ok")
  (ok! 0 "never fails (in clojure)")

  (ok! (= 10 10) "is ten ten?")
  (ok! ok "even ok is ok!")
  (ok! (type ok) "ok is not nil. ok is not nothing.")
  (ok! true "the truth will set you ok.")
  (ok! (not false) "and nothing but the truth.")
  (ok! false "and we'll know if you lie to us" :todo "invent superpowers")

  (ok! (integer? 10) "10 is an integer")
  (ok! (string? "10") "\"10\" is a string")

  (ok! 0 "zero is true" :todo "be more like ruby")
  (ok! nil "nil is true" :skip "not possible in this universe"))

1..15
ok 1
ok 2 - everything is ok
ok 3 - never fails (in clojure)
ok 4 - is ten ten?
ok 5 - even ok is ok!
ok 6 - ok is not nil. ok is not nothing.
ok 7 - the truth will set you ok.
ok 8 - and nothing but the truth.
not ok 9 - and we'll know if you lie to us # TODO invent superpowers
ok 10 - 10 is an integer
ok 11 - "10" is a string
ok 12 - zero is true # BONUS be more like ruby
not ok 13 - nil is true # SKIP not possible in this universe
# 
# ----------------------------------------
# You planned 15, did 13 and had 11 oks.
{:planned-for 15, :last-action :->diag, :oks 11, :counter 13, :diags 6}
